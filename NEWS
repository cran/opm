opm 0.6-0
---------

Bug fixes:

- fixed bug in xy_plot() that caused 'space' to overwrite 'legend.fmt'

- fixed bug in matrix method of do_aggr() causing lists to occur within data 
  frames

- corrections of some substrate names

Other user-visible changes:

- default color set of xy_plot() changed to 'w3c' (because it contains more 
  colors than 'nora')

New features:

- novel functions: substrate_info(), opm_opt(), mypdf(), best_cutoff()

- novel methods for OPM(S) objects: rev(), rep(), sort(), duplicated(),
  anyDuplicated(), sort()

- more arguments for: level_plot(), ci_plot(), merge(), find_substrate(),
  file_pattern(), batch_process(), batch_collect()

. improved behaviour: separate() in 'list.wise' mode, glob_to_regex(),
  `metadata<-`() if data frames with a single column are supplied


opm 0.5-0
---------

Bug fixes:

- fixed 'run_opm.R' bug causing an error in conjunction with '-r template', and 
  bug causing '-s' to be ignored in conjunction with '-r template'

Other user-visible changes:

- normalize_plate_name() has been removed; it is replaced by the novel
  character (and factor) methods for plate_type()

- specific show() method for OPM and OPMS objects

- changed to lazy loading of the datasets (suggestion by Benjamin Hofner)

- `[` was modfied to remove incompatibilties with the 'Matrix' package (which
  IMHO uses setMethod("[", ...) in other ways than specified in the
  documentation of `[` in the base package) (problem noticed by Benjamin 
  Hofner)

New features:

- metadata manipulation is now easier due to the novel formula-based methods
  for metadata()<- and map_metadata() and the novel OPMS/data frame methods
  for metadata()<-

- plotting functionality for 'run_opm.R'

- summary() for OPMS objects is more detailed

- novel plates() methods for lists and OPM objects

- duplicate() and anyDuplicated() get a 'what' argument allowing not only the 
  detection of duplicate OPM objects but also of duplicates of selected 
  components only

- novel contains() method for OPMS objects, and arguments to all contains()
  allowing fine control of strictness

- added factor methods for find_substrate(), find_positions(), glob_to_regex()
  `metadata<-`() and the infix operators; metadata() now betters supports
  factors as keys

- separate() now automatically selects multi- vs. single-character splitting 
  modes if split is a non-empty character vector, and it has a novel 'list.wise'
  argument

- run_kmeans() and do_aggr() methods for matrices


opm 0.4-0
---------

Bug fixes:

- fixed bug in the OPMS method of merge() that caused it to crash with plates
  with unequal numbers of time points

New features:

- added full citation information (first paper on opm) :-)

- radial_plot() and sort() methods for OPMS objects

- phylo_data(), heat_map() and radial_plot() methods directly for OPMS objects

- extract(), select(), discrete() and phylo_data() methods for data frames

- phylo_data() has been enhanced: added export in Hennig86 format for TNT; added
  vector-based merging of rows via the 'join' argument; improved HTML output; 
  added 'run.tidy' option for reformatting the generated HTML with HTML Tidy;
  added 'delete' argument

- for the 'A' parameter estimated using 'opm-fast', CIs that cannot be 
  calculated because the values are constant are not set to NA anymore but to 
  that value

- annoying messages when calling require() for gplots have been silenced

Other changes:

- added the remaining so far missing OPMS-method documentation entries and 
  improved the format of the references

- added example file from a run in identification mode


opm 0.3-3
---------

Bug fixes:

- fixed some testing problems that caused the tests to fail with the novel R 
  for Windows

New features:

- novel methods for the automated discretization of curve heights into 
  positive (+), weak (w) and negative (-) and the subsequent generation
  of reports in HTML for taxonomic journals such as IJSEM; accordingly, quite 
  a few novel helper functions for k-means based discretization: to_kmeans(),  
  borders(), calinski(), and, of course, run_kmeans()

- novel arguments to read_opm() (automatically assorting according to the 
  plate type); similar novel option for opms() to recognize plate types and
  construct OPMS objects separately, or select those with a certain plate type

- redundancies in input plates with 'OTH' as plate type (from runs in 
  identification mode) are now automatically removed

- novel merge() method for OPMS objects, i.e. a function for merging plates 
  from subsequent runs of the same physical plate (of interest for slowly
  reacting organisms)

- map_values() and map_names() have been considerably extended

- novel 'digits' argument to listing(), novel 'pad' argument of safe_labels(),
  novel 'keep.const' and 'simplify' arguments to separate()

Other changes:

- some further improvements of the documentation


opm 0.2-0
---------

Bug fixes:
 
- fixed bug that caused xy_plot() to crash if 'theor.max' was set to FALSE
 
New features:

- novel filename(), aggr_settings(), duplicated(), anyDuplicated(), seq() and 
  oapply() methods for OPMS objects

- novel map_names() and map_values() methods (e.g., for data frames)

- novel separate() function
 
- 'coerce = TRUE' option for map_names(), map_values(), map_metadata() and 
  metadata_chars()

- novel 'include' argument to split_files()

- novel 'plain' argument for do_aggr()

- file input now automatically changes 'OTH' to generation-III plate type

- improved the 'remove.csv.data' behaviour of include_metadata() (the default 
  keys were always removed, and 'remove.csv.data' had a distinct effect)

Removed features:

- curve_params() has been deleted (functionality now integrated in do_aggr())

Other changes:

- many improvements of the documentation
  
- the 'coerce' argument of map_metadata() and metadata_chars() has been renamed
  to 'classes' (to make this uniform)

- 'remove.csv.data' argument of include_metadata() was renamed to 
  'remove.keys',  'stop.on.error' to 'skip.failure' (with the reverse meaning,
  but the default behaviour remains the same)

- changed 'gplots' to default of 'use.fun' argument of heat_map()


opm 0.1-25
----------

- fixed some problems that caused the tests to crash on Windows and Solaris


opm 0.1-24
----------

- initial release to CRAN
