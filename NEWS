opm 0.2-0
---------

Bug fixes:
 
- fixed bug that caused xy_plot() to crash if 'theor.max' was set to FALSE
 
New features:

- novel filename(), aggr_settings(), duplicated(), anyDuplicated(), seq() and 
  oapply() methods for OPMS objects

- novel map_names() and map_values() methods (e.g., for data frames)

- novel separate() function
 
- 'coerce = TRUE' option for map_names(), map_values(), map_metadata() and 
  metadata_chars()

- novel 'include' argument to split_files()

- novel 'plain' argument for do_aggr()

- file input now automatically changes 'OTH' to generation-III plate type

- improved the 'remove.csv.data' behaviour of include_metadata() (the default 
  keys were always removed, and 'remove.csv.data' had a distinct effect)

Removed features:

- curve_params() has been deleted (functionality now integrated in do_aggr())

Other changes:

- many improvements of the documentation
  
- the 'coerce' argument of map_metadata() and metadata_chars() has been renamed
  to 'classes' (to make this uniform)

- 'remove.csv.data' argument of include_metadata() was renamed to 
  'remove.keys',  'stop.on.error' to 'skip.failure' (with the reverse meaning,
  but the default behaviour remains the same)

- changed 'gplots' to default of 'use.fun' argument of heat_map()
